# Counter

Welcome to Counter - the most fun and exciting way to increment and decrement values! The goal of this microproject was to learn modern Neumorphic design.

## What is Neumorphism Design?

Neumorphism Design is a style that uses shadows and highlights to create three-dimensional effects on a user interface element. The style is inspired by Skeuomorphism, which is a design concept that involves making digital interfaces resemble their physical counterparts. There are several elements and principles that makeup neumorphism design, and these key components that give the design its unique look and feel. These include:

- **Subtle Shadows**: A set of subtle dark and light shadows that are used to create the impression of an object floating above the surface. They're typically applied to the edges of the design to create a three-dimensional effect.

- **Rounded edges**: Rounded edges are used to soften the appearance of the design and give it a more tactile and organic look and feel.

- **Soft gradients(optional)**: Soft gradients are used to create the illusion of depth and dimensionality in the design. They're typically used to create a soft, diffused transition between two colors.

In this project `box-shadow` applied dark shadows on the bottom & right sides and light shadows on the top & left sides.
